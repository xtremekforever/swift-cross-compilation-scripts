# Linux Cross-Compilation Scripts for Swift

Since the [Swift build-script](https://github.com/swiftlang) does not yet support cross-compiling to Linux targets, and the work on this is still complex and unclear, this repo aims to provide and maintain some Bash scripts that can cross-compile Swift and core libraries for various architectures and distributions.

These scripts are based on the work done in the [swift-armv7](https://github.com/colemancda/swift-armv7) repo, but expanded to support compiling for more architectures than just armv7.
